# Military Skills Taxonomy Project

## Overview
This repository contains workflows and tools for developing a taxonomy of skills for military operational needs using semantic matching and classification techniques. The project transforms data from multiple sources to create a structured, hierarchical taxonomy that can be used for resource allocation, training program development, and alignment with mission objectives.

## Project Components

### ESCO Skills Processing
The [ESCO-Workflow](./ESCO-Workflow) processes data from the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations dataset to extract structured skill information.

### Military Crosswalk Processing
The [ONET-Crosswalk-Workflow](./ONET-Crosswalk-Workflow) processes the O*NET Military Transition Search crosswalk to extract Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) and their civilian occupation equivalents.

### Taxonomy Creation (Coming Soon)
A future workflow will match the processed ESCO skills with AFSCs to create a comprehensive military skills taxonomy.

## Usage
Each workflow folder contains:
- A detailed README explaining the workflow
- The n8n workflow JSON file
- A Python script that replicates the workflow functionality
- Sample output data

## Implementation Options

### Using n8n
The workflows can be imported into n8n and run directly. This requires:
- Access to an n8n instance
- GitHub authentication credentials
- Import of the workflow JSON files

### Using Python
Alternatively, the included Python scripts can be run independently. These require:
- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: `requests`
- Internet access to fetch the source data

## Project Background
This project is part of an independent study focusing on developing a taxonomy of skills for military operational needs. It uses semantic matching and classification techniques to align with existing taxonomies such as ESCO, OSN, and O*Net.

# ESCO Skills Processing Workflow

## Overview
This workflow extracts and processes skills data from the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) dataset. It prepares the data for matching with military occupational specialties.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**: Fetches raw ESCO data from GitHub
2. **Data Processing**: Extracts skills, their verbs, keywords, and creates searchable text
3. **Data Storage**: Saves the processed data for later use

## Using This Workflow

### Option 1: Run in n8n
1. Import the `esco-workflow.json` file into n8n
2. Configure the GitHub node with your credentials
3. Run the workflow

### Option 2: Run the Python Script
1. Install required dependencies: `pip install requests`
2. Run the script: `python esco_processor.py`
3. Find the output in the `processed_data` directory

## Expected Output
The workflow produces a JSON file containing:
- `processedEscoSkills`: Array of processed skill objects
- `metadata`: Processing information including date and counts
